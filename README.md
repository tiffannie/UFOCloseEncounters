# UFOCloseEncounters
IST 718 Big Data Analytics Final Project

In this research, we sought to answer the following questions:

What areas of the country are most likely to have UFO sightings?
Are there any trends in UFO sightings over time?
Do clusters of UFO sightings correlate with landmarks, such as airports or military bases?
We would also like to create a UFO sighting classifier, and look at algorithms that give us a high prediction accuracy.
